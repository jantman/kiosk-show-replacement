# Edit Slide Form Population Issues

You must read, understand, and follow all instructions in `./README.md` when planning and implementing this feature.

## Overview

There seem to be issues with the population of edit slide modal forms. For example:

* When editing an existing Skedda Calendar slide type, the `iCal/ICS Feed URL` form field is empty and just shows the `https://app.skedda.com/ical/...` placeholder text.
* When editing an uploaded image or video slideshow item, the "Choose File" field shows `No file chosen`, which is misleading.
