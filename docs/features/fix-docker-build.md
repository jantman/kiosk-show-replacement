# Fix Docker Build

You must read, understand, and follow all instructions in `./README.md` when planning and implementing this feature.

## Overview

The Docker build is currently broken and needs to be fixed. Investigate the build failures, identify root causes, and update the Dockerfile and any related configuration to produce a working container image that can run the application.

The fix should ensure:
- The Docker image builds successfully
- The container runs the Flask backend with the built React frontend
- All necessary dependencies are included
- Environment variables and configuration are properly handled
