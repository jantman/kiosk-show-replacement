# Slideshow Transitions Not Working

You must read, understand, and follow all instructions in `./README.md` when planning and implementing this feature.

## Overview

Slideshow transitions do not appear to work. When slides change, they jump directly from one slide to the next with no visible transition effect. There is no observable difference between selecting "Fade" or "Slide" as the transition type - both result in an immediate jump between slides.

This bug needs investigation to determine whether the issue is in the frontend display rendering, the transition CSS/animation implementation, or the configuration not being properly passed to the display.
