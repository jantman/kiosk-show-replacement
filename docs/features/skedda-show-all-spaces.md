# Skedda Show All Spaces

You must read, understand, and follow all instructions in `./README.md` when planning and implementing this feature.

## Overview

Currently, the Skedda slide type only displays the spaces/resources that are present in the shown timeframe. For example, if all reservations for today are for a single space/resource, only that column is shown. This slide type should be updated so that it shows columns for all known spaces/resources, even if some are completely empty in the currently rendered timeframe.
