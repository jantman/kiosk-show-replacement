# Update All Dependencies

You must read, understand, and follow all instructions in `./README.md` when planning and implementing this feature.

## Overview

Update ALL dependencies to their latest versions. For the Python runtime, update to 3.14. For Python dependencies, use `poetry update`. For the Dockerfile, find the latest version of each container on Docker Hub and update accordingly; ask me for help if you need it. For the frontend, update dependencies using the proper tools. Also ensure all GitHub Actions used in workflows are their latest version.
