# Web Page Slide Zoom Issues

You must read, understand, and follow all instructions in `./README.md` when planning and implementing this feature.

## Overview

Two issues have been identified with the web page slide scaling/zoom feature:

1. **Display not updating on zoom changes**: When the scale/zoom setting for a web page slide type is modified in the admin interface, displays are not receiving an update notification. The display continues showing the old zoom level until manually refreshed or the slideshow is reassigned.

2. **Missing admin preview**: The completed feature implementation plan (`docs/features/completed/feature-webpage-slide-scaling.md`) specified an admin preview of the web page zoom, but this preview is not present in the admin interface. Users cannot see how the zoom will appear before saving changes.
