Kiosk.show Replacement - A self-hosted digital signage solution.

This package provides a Flask-based web application for managing digital signage
displays and slideshows, serving as a replacement for the defunct kiosk.show service.

The application serves two primary functions:
1. Allow users to create and manage slideshows through a web interface
2. Serve slideshow content to connected display devices

Key Components:
- Flask web application with both API and server-side rendered interfaces
- SQLAlchemy-based data models for users, displays, slideshows, and content
- File upload and management for images and videos
- Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events
- Responsive admin interface built with React
- Display interface optimized for kiosk devices

This package is designed for collaborative human-AI development with comprehensive
testing, documentation, and deployment automation.
