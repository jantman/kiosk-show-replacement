## Project Info

We are trying to define the outline and requirements of a software project, which will be implemented by a human/AI collaboration. The outline of this project is currently in `ai-project-info.md`. Please help me review this overview outline and figure out if there are any major points or decisions missing.

## Planning

Please read and understand ALL of the `ai-project-info.md` file. Our task is to plan the implementation of this project. We must NOT write any code. Please help me develop a detailed implementation plan for this project, in a new `implementation-plan.md` file. The plan should be broken down into distinct Milestones, each of which is one logical unit of work that can be reviewed, evaluated, and committed. When code is written, each milestone should include full test coverage and completion of the milestone must require complete test coverage and all tests passing. We are working collaboratively on this; please ask me for feedback and guidance whenever you need it, and include my thoughts and opions when planning. The implementation plan should include explicit instructions that the implementers must pause at the end of each milestone and get explicit confirmation before proceeding to the next milestone. Each milestone must also include generating/updating all relevant documentation. The first milestone should include 

## Implementation

Please read over and understand all of the `ai-project-info.md` and `implementation-plan.md` files and ask me any questions that you have. Once you understand our goal, let's begin implementing the first milestone.
