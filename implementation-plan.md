# Kiosk.show Replacement - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the Kiosk.show Replacement project. The implementation is structured into focused milestones designed for human-AI collaboration, with each milestone small enough for thorough human review and understanding.

## Implementation Principles

- **Small, Focused Milestones**: Each milestone represents 1-2 weeks of work and focuses on a specific, reviewable set of functionality
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All milestones include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests where applicable, organized as separate test groups
- **Complete Documentation**: Each milestone includes code documentation, API documentation, user documentation, and developer documentation as applicable
- **Progress Tracking**: A progress tracking document is maintained throughout the implementation process
- **Mandatory Review Process**: Implementation pauses at the end of each milestone for comprehensive review and explicit confirmation before proceeding

## Milestone Review Process

At the end of each milestone, the following process must be followed:

1. **Progress Update**: AI coding assistant updates the progress tracking document with completed work
2. **Gap Analysis**: AI coding assistant reviews code and documentation against the implementation plan and project requirements, identifying and correcting any gaps
3. **Human Review**: Human reviews all milestone work; human and AI discuss improvements and potential "side quests"
4. **Progress Refinement**: AI coding assistant updates progress tracking document based on review discussions
5. **Explicit Confirmation**: AI coding assistant requests human confirmation before proceeding to the next milestone

**⚠️ CRITICAL: No milestone may proceed without explicit human confirmation**

## Testing Strategy

All milestones with code must include comprehensive testing:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and database operations
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows and system behavior (where applicable)

Tests must be organized into separate groups that can be executed independently using `nox`.

## Documentation Requirements

Each milestone must include relevant documentation updates:

- **Code Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and inline comments for human and AI readers
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specs for all API endpoints (where applicable)
- **User Documentation**: Installation, configuration, and usage instructions
- **Developer Documentation**: Architecture decisions, contributing guidelines, and setup instructions

## Learnings and Acceptable Errors/Warnings

### Type Checking (mypy) - Acceptable Remaining Errors

After comprehensive type annotation improvements (86.7% reduction from 83 to 11 errors), the following 11 mypy errors are acceptable and represent limitations of third-party libraries:

#### SQLAlchemy/Flask-Migrate Limitations (11 errors)
- **`flask_migrate.upgrade()`**: No type stubs available for Flask-Migrate's upgrade function
- **SQLAlchemy model methods**: Some SQLAlchemy ORM methods lack proper type definitions
- **Database relationship types**: Complex SQLAlchemy relationship types not fully supported by mypy

These errors are acceptable because:
1. They originate from third-party libraries, not our code
2. The libraries function correctly despite missing type annotations
3. Adding type ignores would reduce code quality without providing value
4. The functionality is well-tested and working properly

### Testing - Expected ResourceWarnings (28 warnings)

During test execution, approximately 28 ResourceWarnings are expected and acceptable:

#### Third-Party Library Cleanup (Expected)
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: ~15-20 warnings from internal connection pooling during test teardown
- **pytest fixtures**: ~5-8 warnings from pytest's own resource management during cleanup
- **Werkzeug/Flask**: ~3-5 warnings from Flask's test client cleanup

These warnings are acceptable because:
1. They occur during test teardown, not during normal application operation
2. They originate from third-party libraries, not our application code
3. Our application code properly manages all resources it creates
4. Test functionality is not affected and all tests pass

#### Application Code - Zero Tolerance
- **All application ResourceWarnings have been eliminated**
- Database sessions are properly closed using NullPool and explicit cleanup
- File handles and other resources are managed with context managers
- Test fixtures properly clean up resources they create

### Code Quality Standards Achieved

#### Database Resource Management
- Enhanced `conftest.py` with NullPool for tests to prevent connection pooling issues
- Implemented comprehensive session cleanup in all test fixtures
- Added explicit database connection disposal in teardown methods
- Replaced manual tempfile usage with pytest's built-in `tmp_path` fixture

#### Type System Improvements
- Added 70+ type annotations across all modules
- Enhanced function signatures with proper parameter and return types
- Fixed timezone imports throughout models (`datetime.UTC` → `timezone.utc`)
- Added comprehensive type annotations to `__all__` variables
- Implemented proper Flask response type annotations

#### Testing Infrastructure
- All 49 tests pass with proper resource management
- Test coverage maintained at 43.03%
- Independent test execution without resource leaks
- Proper fixture cleanup ensuring test isolation

### Command Execution Best Practices

#### Efficiency Guidelines
- **Always redirect command output to files** instead of running commands multiple times
- **Environment must be activated once per terminal session** - Run `eval $(poetry env activate)` at the start of each new terminal session
- Use `nox -s <session>` for all project commands (after environment activation)
- **Analyze output files** rather than piping through tools like `wc -l`
- **Batch similar operations** to reduce redundant command execution

#### Examples of Efficient Command Usage
```bash
# FIRST: Activate environment (once per terminal session)
eval $(poetry env activate)

# ✅ Efficient - redirect and analyze
nox -s test > test_output.txt 2>&1
grep "ResourceWarning" test_output.txt

# ❌ Inefficient - multiple command executions
nox -s test | wc -l
nox -s test | grep "ResourceWarning"
```

### Key Takeaways for Future Development

1. **Resource Management**: Investigate and fix warnings at their source rather than suppressing them
2. **Type Annotations**: Comprehensive typing significantly improves code quality and maintainability
3. **Third-Party Limitations**: Some errors/warnings from external libraries are acceptable when properly documented
4. **Testing Best Practices**: Use pytest fixtures properly and ensure clean resource management
5. **Command Efficiency**: Redirect output to files for analysis to avoid redundant command execution

## Recent Updates and Enhancements

### Display Model Enhancement - Rotation Property (June 15, 2025)

Added rotation property to the Display model to support kiosk displays that need to be rotated:

#### Changes Made:
- **Database Schema**: Added `rotation` column to `displays` table with default value of 0
- **Model Validation**: Added validation to ensure rotation values are one of: 0, 90, 180, 270
- **API Serialization**: Updated `to_dict()` method to include rotation property
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests for rotation validation and default values
- **Database Migration**: Updated sample data and database initialization to support new column

#### Technical Details:
- **Field Type**: Integer with NOT NULL constraint and default value of 0
- **Allowed Values**: 0 (normal), 90 (90° clockwise), 180 (180° rotation), 270 (270° clockwise/90° counter-clockwise)
- **Validation**: SQLAlchemy validator ensures only valid rotation values are accepted
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing displays will default to 0° rotation

#### Future Usage:
- CSS transforms can be applied based on rotation value: `transform: rotate(${rotation}deg)`
- Display interface can dynamically adjust content orientation
- Admin interface can provide rotation selection UI (dropdown/radio buttons)

### Display Model Enhancement - Nullable Owner Support (June 15, 2025)

Added support for displays without owners to enable automatic display registration:

#### Changes Made:
- **Database Schema**: Changed `owner_id` from NOT NULL to nullable in Display model
- **Unique Constraints**: Updated to globally unique display names (since owner_id can be NULL)
- **Model Updates**: Enhanced Display model to handle NULL owner_id and created_by_id
- **Test Coverage**: Added 2 new tests for ownerless displays and global name uniqueness (53 total tests)
- **Database Migration**: Updated schema to support auto-registered displays

#### Technical Details:
- **Owner Field**: `owner_id` is now nullable to support auto-registered displays
- **Unique Constraint**: Display names must be globally unique (across all users and auto-registered displays)
- **Audit Fields**: `created_by_id` is also nullable for auto-registered displays
- **Relationships**: Display.owner and Display.created_by can be None

#### Future Usage:
- Display devices can auto-register on first connection without requiring user assignment
- Admin interface can later assign ownership to auto-registered displays
- Supports kiosk deployment scenarios where displays connect before user setup
